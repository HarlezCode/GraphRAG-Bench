GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.64 GiB of which 432.62 MiB is free. Process 2427975 has 22.78 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 384.00 MiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 0 bytes is allocated by PyTorch, and 0 bytes is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
